    </p>
    <h3>Strengths & Weaknesses</h3>
    <p>Some of my strengths would include, being a smart, kind, optimistic and very detail-oriented person.</p>
    <p>Some of my weaknesses are that  I have a hard time saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to others, sometimes I don‚Äôt have confidence in myself as well as that I struggle while speaking in front of others and that sometimes I often procrastinate while doing my work.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Personality Tests</h3>
    <h4>Personality Type: ISTJ-T ~ Logican</h4>
    <p>When looking at my personality type, I am a Logican, INTP-T who is 54% Introverted, 54% Observant, 52% Thinking, 61% Judging and 79% Turbulent. These traits explain a lot about my personality type such as why I find it harder to socialize with people, am a perfectionist, and how I prefer to have everything organized rather than doing things spontaneously. A fun fact about people with this personality type is that we tend to find studying easier with music, which is true since I cannot focus on my work without music. People with the INTP-T personality type usually mean what they say and when committed to something they always follow through, we also believe that there is only one right way to proceed in any situation and anyone otherwise is trying to bend the rules to suit their own desires. </p>
    <h3>My Blueprint Surveys</h3>
    <h4>Visual Learner</h4>
    <p>When taking the Learning Styles Quiz on myBlueprint, I discovered that I am a Visual Learner. This means that I prefer to learn by looking and seeing, some of the ways that we learn would be by taking detailed notes,  and by visualizing things in our minds.</p>
    <h4>Artistic</h4>
    <p>After taking the interest survey on myBlueprint, I learned that my interest type is "The Artisan (CA)". This interest type often pays attention to minor details and has a unique way of doing things. Artisans often work independently and are often very organized and analytical. </p>
    <h4>Computers</h4>
    <p>The Knowledge survey on myBlueprint revealed that my top subject area is Computers, which was a 100% match. This is good since in the future I am definitely going into the field of Computer Science and/or Web Development. <br> Last summer, I took a course for Python which came in very useful in my Introduction To Computer Science course last semester. Currently, I am working on learning more about web development, which will be very useful in the future. </p>
    <h4>Motivated by - Achievements </h4>
    <p>When looking at what I am motivated by, the survey showed that my top motivation factor is achievement. I need to feel that I have accomplished something which puts my skills, knowledge and abilities to the test.  <br> I always look for ways to feel like I have done something, whether it be checking something off your to-do list every day, or completing a major assignment. I'm always looking for ways to use my unique skills, knowledge and abilities.</p>

    <h3>Experiences </h3>
    <h3> Volunteer Work </h3>
    <h4>Brampton Library </h4>
    <p>I started volunteering at the Brampton library as a program assistant back in April 2023 and so far have earned around 85 hours of volunteer work from them. This experience has taught me a lot, such as how to shelve books properly, work with kids of all ages and how to write book reviews. Another enjoyable part of this experience was that I got to represent the Brampton Library at various events such as the Peel Pride Festival, farmers market, local authors showcase, and help out at their Makerfest. </p>
    <h4>Zebra Robotics </h4>
    <p>My second major volunteer experience was volunteering at Zebra Robotics for the summer of 2023, this experience got me around 120 hours. During the summer I helped the instructors out with various tasks such as supervising the kids, running games and activities for them and mainly teaching them how to code on scratch and Lego robotics. Alongside volunteering, I also learned how to code in Python which came in very useful in my Computer Science course. </p>
    <h4>Elementary Schools </h4>
    <p>My third volunteer place is at my old elementary school Williams Parkway Senior Public School, during exam week, on the days I didn‚Äôt have any exams, summatives or conferences, I went there to volunteer with my old teachers earning roughly 60 hours. This volunteer job had me running various activities for the kids in grades 6 - 8, helping them with their school work and supervising them while the teacher was gone. </p>
    <h3> Competitions </h3>
    <h4>Steamworks</h4>
    <p>One of the many competitions that I have taken part in was Steamworks a hackathon run by Chinguacousy's STAC (Sci-Tech activity committee). This was a very fun experience for me as with a group of my friends we were able to work together to solve various challenges. We ended up placing first in the arts category and second in the coding/technology category. </p>
    <h4>First Robotics Competition </h4>
    <p>Another competition that I am a part of is the First Robotics Competition (FRC), this is a team competition in which a team of students work together to build a robot. I have been a part of our school's robotics team, Team 3560 - Mechawoloves, for two years currently being the team's social media manager. This competition has taught me many new skills, such as new mechanical and electrical skills/concepts, new business strategies and how to use various computer software such as Fusion 360 and AutoCAD. Being part of robotics has helped me improve my coding skills by learning new languages and helped me gain the confidence to talk to other teams about their robot and how it functions. </p>
    <h4> University of Waterloo Math Contests </h4>
    <p>I have been taking part in the University of Waterloo math contests since I was in grade 8, I have written the Guass, Canadian intermediate, Pascal, Caley math contests. Out of all these competitions, I received second place in our school for the Canadian intermediate math contest this year, as well as participation awards in all these competitions. These contests helped me challenge myself to think critically and learn new math skills and concepts. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Hobbies & Intrests</h3>
    <h4>Dance</h4>
    <p>Something that I have loved since I was a young child was dancing. I've done many dance performances, in various dance styles, when I was a child, as well as joining Chinguacousy's Kpop Dance Club, Garba Team, as well as our Bollywood Theatre Club. </p>
    <h4>Art</h4>
    <p>Art is always something that I have always enjoyed since I was a young child. To me,  art is often an escape from reality and all my problems in this world, whenever I'm drawing or painting, I feel like all my problems are disappearing which puts me at ease. </p>
    <h4>Reading </h4>
    <p>Like art, reading is another form of escaping from reality for me. Whenever I am reading, I tend to get lost in the book, especially when the story is really interesting. Some of my current favorite books include the Twisted series,  Rouge Wave, and the King of Sin series. </p>
    <h4> Robotics </h4>
    <p> One of the things I've always done since I was a child was robotics. I was exposed to the world of STEM at a very young age and I've learned a lot because of this. Currently, I am a part of the FRC Team 3560, from Chinguacousy Secondary School. </p>
    <h4> Sports </h4>
    <p>Some of the sports that I enjoy playing are badminton, basketball and running track. This year I am on Chinguacousy Secondary School's Badminton Team. Another thing I enjoy doing in my free time is taking walks around my neighbourhood. </p>
    <h4> Coding </h4>
    <p>Something that I might've mentioned earlier was how I enjoy coding. Whenever I successfully make a program or animation, it gives me a feeling that I have accomplished something. Coding is something that I will definitely be continuing in the future since the employment rate for people in the IT field is increasing daily so there would be a good chance for me to get a job in the future. </p>
    <h4>Travelling </h4>
    <p>One thing that I enjoy a lot is travelling and exploring new places. I've always enjoyed going to a new place and learning new things about their traditions, food and culture. Even though right now I've only been to a few places, when I'm older I will definitely be going to various places whether it's for a vacation, work or even studying. Some of the places, I plan to go to in the future would include Dubai, London, the United States especially New York & Las Vegas, and the Bahamas. </p>
